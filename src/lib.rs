/// An input port with which to read MIDI events
///
/// # Minimum working example
///
/// The following demonstrates how to use this struct. At the very core it is
/// used to read MIDI events from an input port. The [`portmidi`] context needs
/// to be manually created due to lifetime handling of that crate. Next, the
/// [`crate::list_devices`] helper function lists all available devices, which
/// the name can be used to to create a [`crate::MidiInputPort`]. One should
/// ideally also clear the port, as there may be pending messages which will be
/// output right upon starting the program. Finally, we listen to the port, and
/// can execute a callback function on each single event that is received; in
/// this case we simple print it encoded as a [`crate::MidiMessageType`].
///
/// ```
/// use lilypond_midi_input as lmi;

///     let context = portmidi::PortMidi::new().expect("At least one MIDI device available.");
///     let name = "USB-MIDI MIDI 1";
///
///     lmi::list_devices(&context);
///
///     let port = lmi::MidiInputPort::new(name, &context, BUFFER_SIZE)
///         .expect("Port name matches an existing port");

///     port.clear();

    /// out that the port is not emtpy at the end of this function call,
    /// please consult the following in an attempt to fix it.

    /// # Sleeping ...
    ///
    /// Note that we are using a sleep function after reading new information
    /// from the port. This is necessary, as otherwise the pending messages
    /// will not appear one after another &mdash; which seems to make it
    /// very difficult and inefficient to figure out if there are still
    /// pending messages left.
    ///
    /// To avoid spending a lot of time waiting for this function to finish, we
    /// set the sleep timer to as low as possible. It might be that the
    /// timer is set too low in which case the sleep has no effect and the
    /// messages will not appear one after the other. Try putting a little
    /// larger value in the timer until it works.
    ///
    /// If you reach a point where the timer has a big value like 10ms then the
    /// issue is probably not caused by the sleep (see next section).
    ///
    /// # Skipping ...
    ///
    /// You will see in the code that we are skipping the first `None` value
    /// that is obtained. Through experimentation we found out that the
    /// first value yielded in this manner is always `None`. Only after the
    /// first `None` are we getting the pending messages.
    ///
    /// If this function does not clear all pending messages, try inspecting the
    /// output of the port by using the following code inside the loop:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// match port.read_n(self.buffer_size) {
    ///     Ok(events) => println!(events),
    ///     Err(e) => panic!("Error {e}"),
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This way you can see when your pending messages are appearing, in which
    /// case you can modify the if conditions to correctly skip the `None`
    /// values that don't indicate an emptied port.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// Panics if messages failed to be read from the port (see
    /// [portmidi::InputPort::read_n]). For now, it is considered an
    /// irrecoverable error because an uncleared port may lead to undesired
    /// behaviour (such as unwanted messages appearing at the start of the
    /// application). Further, if reading failed here, it may very well fail
    /// later down the road when it comes to reading the actual MIDI data.
