= Real-Time MIDI to LilyPond Notes

Standalone tool reading input from a MIDI device and converting them into LilyPond notes, with integration into other tools as a strong focus.

[#about]
== About

This is a tool specifically targeted at writing {u-lilypond}[LilyPond] scores. Entering notes using a MIDI keyboard is very handy and can greatly speed up the process, for which I always used {u-frescobaldi}[Frescobaldi]. There was an issue however -- I already had a fully personalized setup for writing LilyPond in my text editor of choice, yet always found myself going back to Frescobaldi for the MIDI input; as a result, I ended up writing my scores in Frescobaldi, even beyond the MIDI input. (Frescobaldi is great though!)

`lilypond-midi-input` aims to bridge the gap between MIDI input for LilyPond notes, and any arbitrary text editor which supports async inputs. The idea is that this tool will listen for MIDI inputs from a device, and will transform them into corresponding LilyPond notes that can directly be inserted into your LilyPond files!

This is a standalone program which does just that: Read MIDI inputs from a device, and spit out LilyPond notes onto stdout. This will hopefully make integration into other editors easier. <<basic-usage, Basic usage>> walks through how the program works. For those wishing to integrate this into their editors, please take a look at the <<specifications-for-integration-into-editors, specifications>> on how to handle the input and output streams.

[#non-goals]
== Non-goals

Fully automate text input for LilyPond notes is not an objective for this tool. This means for example that adding note durations will not be handled here. Automatically detecting rhythm during playback is therefore also not an objective of this tool. Such features should be provided/created by wrappers.

Again, the main goal here is to provide translation of MIDI notes into LilyPond notes, and as a result make MIDI input easier to integrate into other editors.

[#installation]
== Installation

You will need https://github.com/PortMidi/PortMidi[PortMidi] installed, regardless of the installation method. Note the `libportmidi-dev` package should only be needed for Ubuntu when building from source.

[,sh]
----
pacman -S portmidi # for arch
apt install libportmidi0 libportmidi-dev # for debian/ubuntu
----

[#pre-built-binaries]
=== Pre-built binaries

The https://github.com/niveK77pur/lilypond-midi-input/releases/latest[latest release] will contain pre-built binaries (different versions due to the PortMidi system library).

* https://github.com/niveK77pur/lilypond-midi-input/releases/latest/download/lilypond-midi-input_debian[Debian], should also work on Ubuntu
* https://github.com/niveK77pur/lilypond-midi-input/releases/latest/download/lilypond-midi-input_archlinux[Arch Linux]

NOTE: Be sure to make the binaries available as `lilypond-midi-input` on your system, without the `++_*++` _extension_. That one was only useful to distinguish the different versions in the release assets.

[#build-from-source]
=== Build from source

You will need {u-cargo}[cargo] and {u-portmidi}[PortMidi] installed to build the project. The binary will be installed as `lilypond-midi-input`.

[,sh]
----
cargo install --path . # inside this repository
----

[#basic-usage]
== Basic Usage

A comprehensive overview of settings and features can be found using the help page. More information can be found <<options, in a later section>>.

[,sh]
----
lilypond-midi-input --help
----

First, you need to specify which MIDI input device this tool should listen to. You can use the following command to get a list of available input devices. Take note of the name for the device of interest, we need to give it to the program to actually run it.

[,sh]
----
$ lilypond-midi-input --list-devices
1) Input: Midi Through Port-0
3) Input: USB-MIDI MIDI 1
4) Input: out
----

Let's say we are interested in the input device listed as number 3 here. You can finally run the tool as follows.

[,sh]
----
lilypond-midi-input "USB-MIDI MIDI 1"
----

NOTE: The name must be an exact match! Leading and trailing spaces in the name are ignored.

To exit, you can simply press `Ctrl+C`.

[#providing-options]
=== Providing Options

As indicated by the `--help` page, you can pass various options via command line flags, which shall not be elaborated on further. It should be mentioned that using command line flags will set the options on start-up and also provides a bit more helpful error messages if arguments are invalid.

The next method discussed will launch the program (with its default values), and allow changing options later. Practically speaking, there really is no major difference between the two methods. If your editor cannot write to this program's stdin stream, you can use these flags as a workaround to relaunch with new settings.

[#changing-options]
=== Changing options

This tool also allows changing/setting the options on-the-fly without restarting the program. To do this, you can directly type into the program's stdin! Meaning that while the program is running, you can simply type commands into the terminal.

Upon successful parsing and execution of the given setting, the program will write a message to stderr, either indicating success or possibly indicating errors. As far as possible, the program tries to inform what has happened (through stderr), as otherwise it is difficult to judge whether the provided settings in stdin where handled correctly or not.

All options here have long and short versions, which the latter are particularly useful when manually typing in the commands into the terminal. A list of options and their values can be found in a <<options, later section>>.

The settings are given in the following form. You can specify one option at a time, or you can provide multiple options at once. A key that takes nested key-value pairs has its value given as `SUBKEY:SUBVALUE` and are comma separated (without spaces). Here are some examples to hopefully clarify.

NOTE: Different options are *space separated*; so currently the values may not contain any spaces. 

----
KEY1=VALUE1
KEY3=SUBKEY1:SUBVALUE1,SUBKEY2:SUBVALUE2
KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2
KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2 KEY3=SUBKEY1:SUBVALUE1,SUBKEY2:SUBVALUE2

[#specifications-for-integration-into-editors]
== Specifications for integration into editors

The interaction with this tool happens fully through stdin, stdout and stderr. Here is how each of these streams are used by this tool, allowing you to properly integrate it into your editor.

[#managing-the-process]
=== Managing the process

Spawning the process is ideally done by your editor, so that it can properly manage all the input and output streams.

Specifics on how to interact with each stream is of course dependent on the editor and its capabilities. You can have a look at <<integrations, existing integrations>> for some examples and inspiration.

IMPORTANT: The tool is not capable of exiting by itself (i.e. there is no `exit` command for example). That said, you should try to kill the process in question, which should ideally be done by your editor.

[#stdin]
=== stdin

As mentioned in <<changing-options>>, the stdin solely takes settings as key-value pairs. Upon successful parsing, the corresponding option will be set/updated internally. A corresponding message will also be written to stderr.

For options and their values, please check the <<options, following section>>; for usage examples please check the section <<changing-options>>.

IMPORTANT: If the program is not responding to inputs being sent through stdin, it is possible that you have provided an invalid option which is simply not being parsed and captured. Or, it is possible that your editor also needs to *add a newline* at the end of the message, in order to trigger Rust to actually read the input line.

[#stdout]
=== stdout

This stream should only output data relevant to the task at hand. In the case of `--list-devices`, it will be the list of devices. In the case of a normal execution, stdout will only have LilyPond notes printed as you input notes through your MIDI keyboard.

That said, stdout can be taken as-is. A user could for example be prompted to pick a MIDI device based on the output of `--list-devices`. Most importantly, during normal execution the outputted LilyPond notes can be taken as-is in order to have them inserted into your text editor.

[#stderr]
=== stderr

This stream contains any other message/information that the tool wants to share but should not be taken as text input by the editor. Currently, this counts general information such as a startup message, and indications that values were updated correctly via stdin. In case an option via stdin was invalid, an error message will also be written to stderr.

Errors are printed using the `echoerr!` macro, while other information is printed using the `echoinfo!` macro, the definition of both are found in {f-macros}[this file]. They prefix each line with a `!!` and `::` respectively. This allows your client/editor to filter the messages from stderr according to actual errors or simple information.

[#providing-a-list-of-options-to-the-user]
=== Providing a list of options to the user

The program also provides a `--list-options` flag, which list all available values for a given argument to stdout. The options are space separated, and no particular effort is made towards providing a well typeset output (i.e. as a tabular); the editors should decide how to treat the information.

The first value in the line corresponds to the actual enum variant's name in the Rust code. The second value corresponds to the primary string from which the variant can be created. All following values are additional strings -- usually shorthands -- which can also be used to describe an enum variant. (See also <<options-for-stdin, the table>>).

All the values (without any `"` or `'`) can be used as-is to set an option via stdin. The second value can be used to set options via the command line arguments.

Using this method to display choices in the editor should be preferred as it avoids hardcoding the values. Further, if values should change, be added, or removed, it will require no intervention in the editor, as this tool can list its own options.

[#options]
== Options

[#command-line-arguments]
=== Command Line Arguments

All flags and the values they can take are shown when running the program with the `--help` flag. Thus, they will not be further discussed.

Of importance to point out are the values expected by `--alerations` and `--global-alterations`. Both of these take a list of comma-separated subkey-subvalue pairs, which are mentioned in <<changing-options, a previous section>>. More concrete details are given in <<options-for-stdin, the table>>.

[#options-for-stdin]
=== Options for stdin

The option keys are the exact same as the command line flags but without the leading dashes. There are a few additional shorthands though. Also, the values it can take are a bit more broad compared to what the command line flags allow. Some of the values also allow shorthands. The following table describes the current options and their values. See also <<changing-options>> for examples on how to actually set them.

2+h| Options
.2+.^h| Values
.2+.^h| Description
.2+.^h| Example

h| Long
h| Short

| key [[option-key]]
| k
| Can take all strings and enum variant names in the {f-keysignature}[list of available keysignatures]
| Affects how accidentals will be printed depending on the given key signature. In GMajor, an Fâ™¯/Gâ™­ will always be printed as `fis` no matter the value of `accidentals`. This can be overridden by alterations.
| `k=BFlatMajor` is equivalent to `key=besM`

| accidentals [[options-accidentals]]
| a
| Can take all strings and enum variant names in the {f-accidentals}[list of accidentals]
| How to print accidentals that are not within the musical key? In the key of FMajor, `sharps` will print a Gâ™¯ (gis), whereas `flats` will print an Aâ™­ (aes).
| `a=sharps` is equivalent to `a=s`

| mode [[options-mode]]
| m
| Can take all strings and enum variant names in the {f-lib}[list of input modes]
| How to handle MIDI input? `Single` will only read one single note at a time as they are pressed. `Chord` will print a LilyPond chord after all notes were released. `PedalChord` merges both, behaving like `Chord` when any of the three pedals are pressed, and behaving like `Single` when all pedals are released. `PedalSingle` inverts the behaviour.
| `mode=Pedal` is equivalent to `m=p`

| alterations [[options-alterations]]
| alt
| Subkey-subvalue pairs. I.e. `key:value` or `key1:value1,key2:value2,...`. The key must be an integer between 0 and 11 inclusive, the value is considered a string (may not contain spaces). Trailing `+` or `-` in the value can be used to adjust the octave up or down respectively. Multiple consecutive trailing `+` or `-` can be used to adjust multiple octaves.
| Set custom alterations within an octave; overrides special considerations for `key` signatures. Ottavation marks are still being set here. The numbers indicate each note in an octave, starting from C=0, Câ™¯=1, D=2, ..., B=11
| `0:hello,10:world` will make every note C output `hello` and every Bâ™­ output `world`, together with their LilyPond ottavations (`'` or `,`). An alteration of `0:bis` will make the note produced by pressing a C always one octave too high; this can be remedied by doing `0:bis-`.

| global-alterations [[options-global-alterations]]
| galt
| Same as `alterations`, without the integer constraint, and without the ottavation adjustments. You can determine the integers through use of the flag which displays the raw midi events (see <<basic-usage>>).
| Set custom alterations over all MIDI notes; further overrides `alterations` and key signatures. The numbers indicate the MIDI value attributed to said note. No ottavation marks (`'` or `,`) are applied.
| `60:hello` will only make middle C print a `hello`.

| previous-chord [[options-previous-chord]]
| pc
| Colon (`:`) separated list of {u-lilypond-absolute-octave}[absolute LilyPond note] strings. Or `clear` to unset the previous chord.
| Explicitly specify a chord which will yield `q` upon repeating. Useful when jumping around the file, and the tool does or does not return `q` appropriately.
| `pc=c,:eis':g` will set `<c, g eis'>` as the previous chord. `pc=clear` will unset/forget the previous chord.

| list [[options-list]]
|
| Long or short version of all other options. Alternatively `all` will list the all values.
| Not exactly an option, but allows listing values for options. Useful to see what the current state is.
| `list=k` or `list=key` list the currently set key signature. `list=all` will list the current values of all options.
